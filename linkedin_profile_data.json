My responsibility is to push frontiers of technology to create next generation products to help people develop skills in the area of AI, Data Science, Cloud-native Development, DevOps, Data Engineering Big Data, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity and. more. A technologist at heart, I focus on value creation using technology rather than technology itself. I am a relentless pursuer of product-market fit. As a Definite Optimist I believe in envisioning the future, and, since vision without a plan is a hallucination, I like to map out a path to achieving the goal. I am motivated by grand visions, hugely ambitious goals and barely possible challenges. The bigger the challenge the stronger the drive.\n\nI prefer small purpose-driven teams. I believe that building the right team is even more important than building the right product. I am honoured to have assembled and lead what I consider to be the best team in the industry. Young, smart, united by a common purpose the team has demonstrated their ability to overcome the toughest obstacles and go toe-to-toe with the best venture funded startups. \n\nI also advise a number of promising startups. It is something that I enjoy as it helps me apply my experience towards helping the next generation of entrepreneurs. \n\nSpecialties: AI, Database systems, Big Data, Data Science and Cloud Computing.",

Configuring and maintaining productive open data science environment is a difficult and distracting chore. There are choices of programming languages, 10s of thousands of libraries for each of the languages, programming tools such as notebooks and IDEs, tools for data preparation, and big data systems such as analytics databases, Hadoop, Spark etc.\nData Scientist Workbench makes Open Data Science easy by creating an environment that is ready to use in minutes using nothing more than a web browser. It has popular tools such as Jupiter and Zeppelin notebooks, RStudio, OpenRefine all set up with popular libraries. And if your favourite library is not there, simply pull it in from a public repository. For those that need to work with large data sets, Apache Spark is integrated in to the Data Scientist Workbench as is ability to submit jobs for execution on your own Spark or Hadoop cluster or submit analytics jobs to analytics DBMS such as IBM dashDB. Data Scientist Workbench supports the entire work cycle including data discovery, data preparation, machine learning, deep learning, data visualization and publishing. It also makes it easy to collaborate with colleagues and community at large.\nMost important, we build Data Scientist Workbench completely in the open with extensive feedback from our users. Our users are fully engaged by suggesting features they would like to see, getting support and votes from others in the community for their ideas. This resulted in exponential growth of our user base with over eleven thousand data scientists signing on in just a few short month without any marketing or advertising on our part. Data Scientist Workbench is delivered in the cloud globally from multiple distributed data centers and is optimized for unique needs of people in different parts of the world including China. ",

            "description": "IBM IM Demo Cloud dramatically accelerates sales cycles by providing IBM sellers and business partners with ability to create environments for hands-on experimentation, as well as ability to conduct Proof of Concept and new product introductions with prospective clients.\nTypical environments can be provisioned and delivered to the customer in 10 minutes. Customers do not need to perform any of the tasks that detract from productive evaluation experience or slow down the sales process. Clients get immediate access to completely configured multi-server, multi-product environments that mirror potential production deployment of technologies and products being evaluated. Both seller and customers maintain complete visibility and are able to collaborate to achieve desired results. Over 250 IBM and business partners are currently using IM Demo Cloud to deliver IBM Big Data and other Information Management projects.",

        "Polong Lin\n\n\n\nI was very lucky to have Leon as my manager during my four years at IBM. Because of Leon's passion to innovate, we were constantly at the forefront of thought leadership whether it was cloud, AI or blockchain, and Leon was always searching for the \"next big thing\". He had an intense focus on users, and this brought forth in the team an ability to develop products that successfully grew to widespread adoption.\nLeon constantly pushed me beyond my comfort zone, taught me how to formulate new projects, manage relationships, and to build-measure-learn. From developer advocacy to marketing to entrepreneurship, the skills that I learned on Leon's team were endless. Never afraid to admit when he was wrong, Leon always put the team ahead of himself, and he created an environment where everyone was safe to learn, explore and even fail. He taught me to dream big and how to make dreams reality. \nI couldn\u2019t recommend Leon more.",
        "Ari Valtanen\n\n\n\nI have worked with Leon in direct and indirect management roles, related to IBM data management and big data products. We've done technical evangelism, customer and partner enablement, poc&pilot deployments in the Cloud(s), etc.\r\n\r\nWhat continues to amaze me is his speed of execution, his talent and skill to build and motivate small but extremely effective A-teams, who get things done exceeding the expectations and beating the metrics.  This usually happens without the brouhaha and bravado, but at the end you'll see the results.\r\n\r\nLeon is a great manager, passionate leader, and always ready to recognize and take care of his team.\r\n\r\nBut that's only starters.  Leon is very spirited and engaging speaker, and after you've listened to him for just few minutes you realize how clearly and simply he is able to explain even the most complex topics, topics typically new or emerging where 'standard canned explanation' do not yet exist.  That's the result of staying current, researching, thinking, understanding and finally capturing the essence of new things, which takes a LOT of work, LOTS of experience, and also a good amount of natural talent.  Leon has it all."
